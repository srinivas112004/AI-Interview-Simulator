            2. If reference / sample answer is provided, check whether the candidate captures the key points or core concepts.
            3. DO NOT penalize conciseness! A clear, concise, accurate answer (even 1-2 sentences) SHOULD receive a high score (8.0 to 10.0).
            4. If the candidate correctly states the difference, definition, or premise, score MUST be >= 7.5.
            5. Only assign a low or failing score (< 6.5) if the answer is factually incorrect, completely irrelevant, or severely misleading.
